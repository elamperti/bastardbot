BastardBot
==========

This bot connects to Google Hangouts using [hangups](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups/).

It will use/interact with the conversations *soon*.


Trying it out
-------------

The bot is not ready yet. Currently it just barks back when someone says something.

**IMPORTANT**: Python 3.3 or higher is required to use hangups.
You can install `pyenv`, which will make your life *a lot* easier. 
Here's a [good tutorial about pyenv](http://davebehnke.com/python-pyenv-ubuntu.html).

The first time you start hangups, you will be prompted to log into your Google
account. Your credentials will only be sent to Google, and only session cookies
will be stored locally.

Documentation, help and feedback are welcome.

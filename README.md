BastardBot
==========

This bot connects to Google Hangouts conversations using
[hangups](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups/), by Tom Dryer.

It will let you use/interact with the conversations *soon*.


Trying it out
-------------

The bot is not ready yet!

**IMPORTANT**: Python 3.3 or higher is required by hangups.
You can install `pyenv`, which will make your life *a lot* easier. 
Here's a [good tutorial about pyenv](http://davebehnke.com/python-pyenv-ubuntu.html).

The first time you start BastardBot, you will be prompted to log into your Google
account by the hangups library. It only sends your credentials to Google, and it 
stores session cookies locally.

Documentation, help and feedback are welcome.
